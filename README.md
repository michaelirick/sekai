# README

This is a Rails app to help organize my worldbuilding. I am a big user of WorldAnvil but have more specific needs. This application will heavily leverage what was developed in my conlang app, Lehintos.

## Major Concepts

The major concepts are the Map and the History.

### Map

Perhaps the most important feature is the Map. In WorldAnvil and other tools, the map is a representation of whatever idea the worldbuilder is building and the user is generally allowed to add multiple maps for the same world. In Yuusekai, the Map is the world as an abstract, yet physical, entity. At it's base, it's a collection of hexagons of about 100sqmi which are collected into larger groupings inspired by Clausewitz Engine games (smallest to largest, Hex, Province, Area, Region, Subcontinent, Continent, World).

### History

Next is the History. WorldAnvil has a very nice concept of history with its timeline feature. I really like the concept of Timelines and Eras
